# Stock-Journal
This is a journal of all my option trades I've made through Webull and an analysis of the trades in order to practice my Python data analysis skills.
I will be specifically focusing on option trades as this is what I have been trading and studying the most within the past year or two.

You may open it the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab by clicking the link "Open in Colab" on the Python file page here.
